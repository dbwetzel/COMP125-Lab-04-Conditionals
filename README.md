# Lab 4 - Conditional Statements

_Make a P5 sketch interactive with if() else_

1. add some code into the if( ){} else {} statements to make the circle **change color** when the mouse is pressed.

2. for **extra credit** (1pt), restructure this so that the if() statement also controls the value of a variable that **re-sizes** or **moves** the circle. 

3. **download** your lab project as a Zip archive and submit it (with a link to your repl) on **Sakai**
